# DevOps

**Jenkins**
- Open Source Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) tool written in JAVA.
- An automation server used to build and deliver software projects
- Lots of plugins available
- Popular CI software available and free 
- It doesn't merge code nor it resolves code conflicts, that's still for good the developer to do.
- developers should push their changes to a version control, which should  then be build and tested - which can be done by Jenkins

## CI/CD

```
Continuous Integration(CI) is a practice, in software engineering, of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day

Continuous Delivery(CD) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time.
